## Key Findings

### Strengths

1. **Medium-complexity patterns**: GPT-OSS handles 16×16 grids with moderate complexity well (14.6% accuracy)

2. **Pattern recognition**: Model successfully identifies transformation rules when:
   - Training examples are clear and consistent
   - Patterns involve symmetry and repetition
   - Color transformations are straightforward

3. **Code generation**: When successful, the model generates correct Python code using library primitives to implement transformations

4. **First attempt success rate**: Many correct solutions (like 833dafe3) are solved on the first attempt, indicating strong pattern recognition

### Weaknesses

1. **Large grid scaling**: Struggles with grids larger than ~20×20
   - Selected incorrect tasks range from 19×19 to 27×27
   - Computational complexity and pattern complexity both increase

2. **Generation failures**: 95 tasks (41.9%) result in no solution
   - Empty solution arrays indicate primitive evaluation failures
   - Timeout issues with complex code execution
   - Indicates fundamental challenges in code synthesis for difficult problems

3. **Incorrect solutions**: 99 tasks (43.6%) generated wrong answers
   - Model attempts solution but transformation logic is incorrect
   - Pattern generalization from training examples fails
   - Shows model can synthesize code but struggles with pattern identification

4. **Fix attempts**: The fix layer (6 additional attempts) may not be effectively correcting initial errors
   - Many incorrect solutions persist despite multiple fix attempts

### Computational Bottlenecks

1. **Primitive evaluation time**: ~10 minutes per challenge dominated by CPU-bound primitive evaluation
2. **Sequential processing**: No parallelization of challenge solving
3. **GPU utilization**: Low during primitive evaluation phase (CPU-bound subprocess execution)

---

## Comparison with Baseline

According to the summary context:
- **Previous empty library run**: 7% accuracy
- **Current run with 538 primitives**: 14.6% accuracy
- **Improvement**: +7.6 percentage points (~2× improvement)

The library provides significant value, demonstrating that pre-trained primitives enhance the model's ability to construct correct solutions.

---

## Recommendations

### Short-term Improvements

1. **Parallel primitive evaluation**: Batch evaluate primitives to reduce per-challenge time
2. **Timeout optimization**: Implement smarter timeout strategies for large grids
3. **Context prioritization**: Focus limited context on most relevant primitives

### Long-term Research Directions

1. **Grid size adaptation**: Develop strategies for handling larger grids
   - Hierarchical decomposition
   - Region-based processing
   - Adaptive resolution

2. **Fix strategy refinement**: Improve the fix layer's effectiveness
   - Better error diagnosis
   - Targeted correction prompts
   - Incremental debugging

3. **Library expansion**: Continue growing the primitive library
   - Focus on spatial transformation primitives
   - Add primitives for large grid handling
   - Include composition strategies

4. **Hybrid approach**: Combine symbolic reasoning with neural generation
   - Use model for pattern recognition
   - Use symbolic solver for execution
