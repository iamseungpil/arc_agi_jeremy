We need to deduce transformation rule from examples. The first set: 13x13 grid with many 8s (purple?) and 1s scattered. Output shows many cells changed to 1,3,2 etc. Looks like we are filling pattern around the 1s? Let's analyze.

Input 1: 13x13 grid, all 8s except some 1s at coordinates: (1,11) (0-index?), let's index: row 0: all 8s. Row1: col11 has 1. Row3: col2 has 1. Row6: col9 has 1. Row9: col5 has 1. Others all 8. Output 1: a pattern: Looks like the 1s produce a cross shape? Let's examine output coordinates: Many 1s now. Let's locate 1s in output: row0: none? row0 has 8,8,1 at col2? Wait output row0: 8,8,1,8,8,1,8,8,8,1,3,1,3. So at row0, col2, col5, col9, col11, col13? Actually 13 columns 0-12. Output row0: indices: 0:8,1:8,2:1,3:8,4:8,5:1,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:1,10:3,11:1,12:3. So 1s at col2,5,9,11. The input had 1 at row1 col11 (near top right). Now output has 1 at row0 col11 (just above?) and 1 at row0 col9 (left of that). Also 1 at row0 col5 and col2. It seems like from each 1 in input, a pattern of 1s extends outward? Also output has 3s at some positions where originally 8. Where are 3s? Row0 col10 and 12. Row1 has 2 at col11. Row2: 1 at col2, 3 at col4? Wait row2 output: [8,3,1,3,8,1,8,8,8,1,3,1,3]. So 3s at col1,3,5,9,11? Actually 3 at col1,3,5,9,11? Let's check: row2: index0=8,1=3,2=1,3=3,4=8,5=1,6=8,7=8,8=8,9=1,10=3,11=1,12=3. So 3s at 1,3,10,12.

Observation: The output seems to fill the whole grid with a pattern of 1s and 3s, maybe replicating a 3x3 tile? Actually looks like a checkerboard of 1s and 3s maybe? Let's see pattern: 1s at positions where (row+col) even? Let's test: For output, positions with 1: (0,2) sum=2 even; (0,5)=5 odd? Wait 5 odd. So not parity.

Maybe pattern is based on distance from nearest input 1? Let's compute distances. Input 1s at (1,11),(3,2),(6,9),(9,5). Output seems to have many 1s maybe along lines connecting them? Let's check: There's a vertical line of 1s along column 11: rows 0-3? Actually output column11: row0=1, row1=1, row2=1, row3=1, row4=1, row5=1, row6=1, row7=1, row8=1, row9=1, row10=1, row11=1, row12=1? Wait output row4 col11=1, row5 col11=1? Let's check row4: [8,3,1,3,8,1,8,8,8,1,8,1,8] => col11 index 11 is 1. Row5: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8,8,3,1,3,1,8] => col11=1. Row6: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1] => col11=1? Wait row6 has 13 columns: indices 0-12. Row6: 0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1,7:1,8:1,9:2,10:1,11:1,12:1. So col11=1. Row7: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8,8,3,1,3,1,8] => col11=1. Row8: [8,8,1,8,3,1,3,8,8,1,8,1,8] => col11=1. Row9: [1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] => col11=1. Row10: [8,8,1,8,3,1,3,8,8,1,8,1,8] => col11=1. Row11: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8,8,8,1,8,1,8] => col11=1. Row12: [8,8,1,8,8,1,8,8,8,1,8,1,8] => col11=1.

So column 11 is all 1s in output. That matches input had a 1 at (1,11) and maybe we extended down to all cells? But note row3 col11 originally 8, changed to 1. So vertical line.

Similarly column 2 maybe also all 1s? Let's check output column2: row0=1, row1=1, row2=1, row3=1? Row3: [1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] => col2=2? Wait row3 col2 is 2. So not all 1. Let's check: row0 col2=1, row1 col2=1, row2 col2=1, row3 col2=2, row4 col2=1, row5 col2=1, row6 col2=1, row7 col2=1, row8 col2=1, row9 col2=1, row10 col2=1, row11 col2=1, row12 col2=1. So column2 has a single 2 at row3.

Similarly column9 maybe all 1s? Output column9: row0=1, row1=1, row2=1, row3=1, row4=1, row5=1, row6=2, row7=1, row8=1, row9=1, row10=1, row11=1, row12=1. So column9 has a 2 at row6.

So pattern: The input 1s are at four positions: (1,11),(3,2),(6,9),(9,5). Output seems to have vertical lines at columns of these 1s: col11, col2, col9, col5. In each vertical line, there's a 2 at the row where the original 1 was? Let's check: For col11, original 1 at row1. But in output col11, the 2 appears at row6? Wait row6 col11=1 not 2. So maybe 2 appears at the intersection of vertical lines? Actually 2s at row3 col2, row6 col9, row? Let's list 2 positions: from output: row3 col2=2; row6 col9=2; row6 col? also at col? row6 col9 is 2. And row? row3 col? also 2 at col? row3 col? row3 col? Actually row3 has 2 at col2 only. Row6 has 2 at col9 only. Are there any other 2s? Row3 col? row? Row? row? Let's scan: row3: only col2 is 2. Row6: only col9 is 2. Row? row? there is also a 2 at row3 col? maybe col2. And row6 col9. Also row3 col? maybe col? no. Also row? row? row? row? So 2s correspond to original 1 positions? But original 1 at (3,2) and (6,9). Yes. So 2s appear at those positions. So the input 1s become 2 in output? But in input, 1s at (1,11),(3,2),(6,9),(9,5). Output shows 2s at (3,2) and (6,9) but not at (1,11) or (9,5). Instead, at (1,11) in output remains 1. At (9,5) remains 1. So maybe 2s are at the intersection of vertical lines? Wait vertical line at col2 and col9, their intersection with horizontal lines? Let's see horizontal lines: Are there horizontal lines of 1s at rows of these 1s? Row1 has 1 at col11 but also other 1s at row1? Output row1: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1]. So row1 has 1s everywhere except col11? Actually row1 col11=2? Wait row1 col11 index 11 has value 2. So row1 has 1s across all columns except col11 which is 2. So horizontal line across row1. Row3 has 1s except col2 which is 2. Row6 has 1s except col9=2. Row9 has 1s except col5? Let's check row9: [1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] => yes col5=2. So horizontal lines at rows 1,3,6,9. And vertical lines at columns 2,5,9,11. So all intersections of these horizontal and vertical lines become 1 except the intersection where both are vertical/horizontal? Wait intersection of vertical line col2 and horizontal row3 is (3,2) which is 2. Similarly (6,9)->2. (1,11)->? Intersection of horizontal row1 and vertical col11: (1,11) is 2? Let's check output: row1 col11=2. Yes. So all four intersections are 2. The other cells along the lines are 1. So the 2s appear at the original 1 positions. So the rule seems: For each 1 in input, draw a cross (row and column) of 1s across the entire grid, and at the intersection point (original 1) put a 2. But in output, the 2 is at that intersection, and the rest of the cross cells are 1. That matches: For each 1 in input, entire row and column become 1 (except intersection). And intersection becomes 2.

But we also see 3s in output. Where do 3s come from? They appear at positions that are not on any cross? Let's check a few: row0 col10=3, row0 col12=3, row2 col1=3, row2 col3=3, row2 col10=3, row2 col12=3, row4 col1=3, row4 col3=3, row5 col8=3, row5 col10=3, row6 col? row6 has no 3s. Row7 col8=3, row7 col10=3. Row8 col3=3, row8 col5=3. Row10 col3=3, row10 col5=3. Row12 col3=3, row12 col5=3. So 3s appear in pattern that looks like a checkerboard of 3s in the spaces between crosses? Let's examine pattern of 1s. The grid has 13x13. The cross lines at rows 1,3,6,9 and columns 2,5,9,11. So the rest of cells are not part of any cross. Those cells maybe are colored 3 if they are at a certain distance from crosses? Let's analyze the pattern of 3s: They appear at positions where both row and column are not in the cross line list? For example, (0,0) is not in any cross; output at (0,0)=8 in output? Wait row0 col0=8. So not 3. (0,1) not cross; output row0 col1=8. So 8 remains 8. (0,2) is cross column2, so 1. (0,4) not cross; output row0 col4=8. So 8 remains. So 3s appear only in some of those non-cross cells, specifically those that are at the intersection of a vertical line of 2? Wait no.

Let's check 3 positions: (0,10) column10 not cross; row0 not cross; but 3 appears. (0,12) same. (2,1) row2 not cross, col1 not cross => 3. (2,3) row2 not cross, col3 not cross => 3. (2,10) row2 not cross, col10 not cross => 3. (2,12) same. (4,1) row4 not cross, col1 not cross => 3. (4,3) same. (5,8) row5 not cross, col8 not cross => 3. (5,10) same. (7,8) row7 not cross, col8 not cross => 3. (7,10) same. (8,3) row8 not cross, col3 not cross => 3. (8,5) row8 not cross, col5 is cross? Wait col5 is a cross line. But row8 not cross. But (8,5) output is 3. So 3 appears even if column is cross? Wait col5 is cross. But maybe because row8 not cross, but column5 cross line means that cell is part of cross? Let's examine: In output, column5 values: row0 col5=1 (cross), row1 col5=1, row2 col5=1, row3 col5=1, row4 col5=1, row5 col5=1, row6 col5=1, row7 col5=1, row8 col5=1, row9 col5=2, row10 col5=1, row11 col5=1, row12 col5=1. So column5 is a cross line; all cells in that column are 1 or 2. So (8,5) cannot be 3. Wait but earlier I said row8 col5 output is 3; let's check output row8: [8,8,1,8,3,1,3,8,8,1,8,1,8]. So row8 col5 is 1 not 3. Sorry misread. So 3s only at columns not cross. So 3s appear in cells such that both row and column are not cross lines. But not all such cells are 3; many remain 8. Which ones become 3? Let's list all cells where row not in R = {1,3,6,9} and col not in C = {2,5,9,11}. That's the set of cells that are not on any cross. In the 13x13 grid, that's 9 rows * 9 columns = 81 cells. Among these, 3s appear in about 24 cells (approx). Which pattern? Let's check coordinates of 3s:

- (0,10),(0,12)
- (2,1),(2,3),(2,10),(2,12)
- (4,1),(4,3)
- (5,8),(5,10)
- (7,8),(7,10)
- (8,3),(8,5)
- (10,3),(10,5)
- (12,3),(12,5)

Also maybe others? Let's double-check: Did we miss any 3 at (5,8) yes. At (5,10). At (5,? maybe 12?) row5 col12=8. At (7,8),(7,10). At (8,3),(8,5). At (10,3),(10,5). At (12,3),(12,5). Also (4,? maybe 5)? But col5 is cross. So no. (8,1)? row8 col1=8. (12,1)? 8. So pattern of 3s seems to form a shape: They form a pattern of two columns of 3s at columns 10,12 on rows 0,2? Actually 10,12 columns: row0 and row2 have 3s. Then at columns 1,3 on rows 2,4,10,12. Then at columns 8,10 on rows 5,7. Then at columns 3,5 on rows 8,10,12? Wait 3s at (8,3),(8,5),(10,3),(10,5),(12,3),(12,5). So it's like a checkerboard of 3s in the region defined by rows 8-12 and columns 3-5? But not all cells in that block are 3; except the corners? Actually block rows 8-12, cols 3-5: coordinates: (8,3)=3,(8,4)=8,(8,5)=1; (9,3)=? row9 col3=1, not 3; (9,4)=? 1; (9,5)=2; (10,3)=3,(10,4)=8,(10,5)=3; (11,3)=1; (11,4)=8; (11,5)=1; (12,3)=3,(12,4)=8,(12,5)=3. So 3s at (8,3),(10,3),(12,3),(10,5),(12,5). So pattern of 3s at alternating rows.

Seems like 3s fill a checkerboard pattern across the grid, but offset by 2? Let's see: maybe 3s at positions where (row+col) mod 4 = something? Let's compute for some 3s:

(0,10): row+col=10 mod? 10 mod 4=2
(0,12):12 mod4=0
(2,1):3 mod4=3
(2,3):5 mod4=1
(2,10):12 mod4=0
(2,12):14 mod4=2
(4,1):5 mod4=1
(4,3):7 mod4=3
(5,8):13 mod4=1
(5,10):15 mod4=3
(7,8):15 mod4=3
(7,10):17 mod4=1
(8,3):11 mod4=3
(8,5):13 mod4=1
(10,3):13 mod4=1
(10,5):15 mod4=3
(12,3):15 mod4=3
(12,5):17 mod4=1

So 3s appear at positions where (row+col)%4 is 1 or 3? Actually for each we got mod4 values of 0,1,2,3. We have 0,1,2,3 all appear. But maybe pattern is that 3s are at positions where both row and column are odd? Let's check: (0,10): row even, col even => both even? 0 even,10 even -> both even. (0,12): both even. (2,1): row even, col odd. (2,3): both even? row 2 even, col3 odd. (2,10): both even. (2,12): both even. (4,1): row even, col odd. (4,3): even, odd. (5,8): row odd, col even. (5,10): odd, even. (7,8): odd, even. (7,10): odd, even. (8,3): even, odd. (8,5): even, odd. (10,3): even, odd. (10,5): even, odd. (12,3): even, odd. (12,5): even, odd. So 3s appear at all cells where row is even or odd? Actually all cells not on cross lines? But many such cells are not 3. Let's check a non-3 cell: (0,0) is not cross, both even, but output is 8. So why some even-even cells are 3, others 8? Let's check pattern of 3s: They seem to form a pattern of 3s along a diagonal band? Let's view 13x13 grid: It seems that 3s appear at positions where difference between row and column mod something? Let's compute row-col: (0,10) diff=-10; (0,12) diff=-12; (2,1) diff=1; (2,3) diff=-1; (2,10) diff=-8; (2,12) diff=-10; (4,1) diff=3; (4,3) diff=1; (5,8) diff=-3; (5,10) diff=-5; (7,8) diff=-1; (7,10) diff=-3; (8,3) diff=5; (8,5) diff=3; (10,3) diff=7; (10,5) diff=5; (12,3) diff=9; (12,5) diff=7. Not obvious.

Maybe 3s are placed at positions that are at distance 3 from nearest cross? Let's compute distance to nearest cross for a cell not on cross. For (0,10): nearest cross row? cross rows are 1,3,6,9; nearest vertical cross col2,5,9,11. Distances: row distance min(|0-1|=1, |0-3|=3, etc) =1. col distance min(|10-2|=8,|10-5|=5,|10-9|=1,|10-11|=1)=1. So Manhattan distance maybe 2? Actually nearest cross intersection maybe at (1,11) distance |0-1|+|10-11|=1+1=2. So maybe 3s are at cells that are at Manhattan distance 2 from a cross intersection? Let's check (0,12): nearest intersection maybe (1,11) distance |0-1|+|12-11|=1+1=2 -> yes. (2,1): nearest intersection maybe (3,2) distance |2-3|+|1-2|=1+1=2 -> yes. (2,3): nearest intersection (1,2) distance? Wait (1,2) is not intersection; intersections are (1,11),(3,2),(6,9),(9,5). For (2,3), distance to (3,2)=|2-3|+|3-2|=1+1=2; yes. (2,10): nearest intersection (1,11): |2-1|+|10-11|=1+1=2. (2,12): nearest intersection (1,11): |2-1|+|12-11|=1+1=2. (4,1): nearest intersection (3,2): |4-3|+|1-2|=1+1=2. (4,3): nearest intersection (3,2): |4-3|+|3-2|=1+1=2. (5,8): nearest intersection (6,9): |5-6|+|8-9|=1+1=2. (5,10): nearest intersection (6,9): |5-6|+|10-9|=1+1=2. (7,8): nearest intersection (6,9): |7-6|+|8-9|=1+1=2. (7,10): nearest intersection (6,9): |7-6|+|10-9|=1+1=2. (8,3): nearest intersection (9,5): |8-9|+|3-5|=1+2=3? Actually 1+2=3. But maybe nearest intersection is (6,9)? |8-6|+|3-9|=2+6=8. So nearest is (9,5) distance 3. But 3 appears. So maybe rule: cells at Manhattan distance 2 from an intersection become 3? But (8,3) distance 3. So maybe not.

Wait maybe 3s appear at cells that are at Manhattan distance 2 from intersection along a diagonal line? Let's check pattern: For each intersection (r,c), the cells at positions (r±1, c±1) (i.e., distance 2 diagonally) are 3s? Let's examine intersection (1,11). The cells at (0,10),(0,12),(2,10),(2,12) are indeed 3s. Good. Intersection (3,2): cells at (2,1),(2,3),(4,1),(4,3) are 3s. Intersection (6,9): cells at (5,8),(5,10),(7,8),(7,10) are 3s. Intersection (9,5): cells at (8,4),(8,6),(10,4),(10,6). But output shows 3s at (8,3),(8,5),(10,3),(10,5). Wait those are offset by (±1,±1) but with column difference 2? Actually intersection (9,5) plus (±1,±1) gives (8,4),(8,6),(10,4),(10,6). But output shows (8,3),(8,5),(10,3),(10,5). So columns differ by 2 from intersection? Let's check: intersection (9,5), 3s at col 3 and 5? That means columns 3 and 5. So col difference from intersection: 2 and 0. Wait intersection col 5, col3 difference -2. That's not ±1. So maybe 3s at (r-1,c-2),(r-1,c),(r+1,c-2),(r+1,c)? For intersection (1,11): (0,9),(0,11),(2,9),(2,11) would be 3s? But output has (0,10),(0,12),(2,10),(2,12). So pattern is (r±1,c±1) indeed for intersections 1,11; 3,2; 6,9. But for intersection 9,5, pattern seems offset: 3s at (8,3),(8,5),(10,3),(10,5). Let's check if maybe intersection at (9,5) had 2 at (9,5). Then 3s at (8,4),(8,6),(10,4),(10,6) would be off-grid? Actually (8,4) is 8; (8,6) is 1? Wait output row8 col4=8, col6=1. So no. So maybe the intersection at (9,5) is special because the row 9 is not part of cross? Wait row9 is part of cross: horizontal line at row9. So intersection at (9,5) is part of cross. So maybe the cross at (9,5) is not part of the cross pattern? But it's a horizontal line at row9. So intersection at (9,5) is part of cross. So why are 3s not at (8,4),(8,6),(10,4),(10,6)? Let's check output for those positions: (8,4)=8, (8,6)=1, (10,4)=8, (10,6)=1. So not 3. Instead 3s at (8,3),(8,5),(10,3),(10,5). So pattern is (r±1,c-2) and (r±1,c)? Actually (r-1,c-2) gives (8,3),(8,3). (r-1,c) gives (8,5). (r+1,c-2) gives (10,3). (r+1,c) gives (10,5). So pattern of 3s at left column offset by -2 relative to intersection. That's weird. But maybe because the cross lines at row9 and col5 are adjacent to other cross lines causing overlapping? Let's analyze the spacing: The vertical cross lines at columns 2,5,9,11. The horizontal cross lines at rows 1,3,6,9. For intersection (9,5), the surrounding cells diagonally are at (8,4),(8,6),(10,4),(10,6). But these cells are at row 8 and 10 which are not cross rows, and column 4 and 6 which are not cross columns. So they are non-cross cells. Why did they not get 3? Might be because they are too close to other crosses? Let's see distances: cell (8,4) distance to nearest cross: row difference to nearest cross row: |8-6|=2, |8-9|=1. column difference to nearest cross column: |4-5|=1. So Manhattan distance to intersection (9,5) is 1+1=2. So should be 3? But it's 8. Why? But maybe there is another intersection closer: For cell (8,4), nearest cross intersection maybe (6,9)? distance |8-6|+|4-9|=2+5=7. Intersection (3,2): distance |8-3|+|4-2|=5+2=7. Intersection (1,11): distance |8-1|+|4-11|=7+7=14. Intersection (9,5): distance 2. So nearest is intersection (9,5). So should be 3? But not. So maybe rule is: cells at Manhattan distance 2 from any intersection but not adjacent to any cross line? But (8,4) is adjacent to cross column 5 and row 6? Actually row 8 is two rows below row6, column 4 is one left of column5. But it's adjacent to cross column 5? Actually column 5 is cross column. So cell (8,4) is next to cross column 5? It's column difference 1 from 5, row difference 2 from 6, but it's not directly touching cross? But maybe adjacency defined by orthogonal neighbors? (8,4) has neighbor (8,5) which is cross column 5. So it's adjacent to cross. Perhaps 3s are only placed at cells that are not adjacent to any cross? Let's test: For cells that are at distance 2 diagonally from intersection, they are adjacent to cross columns and rows? For intersection (1,11), cells (0,10),(0,12),(2,10),(2,12) are adjacent to cross columns 11 and 10? Wait 10 is not cross. But column 10 is adjacent to cross column 11? It's one column away. So (0,10) has neighbor (0,11) which is cross column 11. So it's adjacent. But it still gets 3. So adjacency doesn't rule it out. Hmm.

Let's analyze pattern of 3s relative to crosses: They form a pattern of "X" shapes around each intersection? For intersections (1,11),(3,2),(6,9) we see 4 cells each. For intersection (9,5) we see 4 cells but offset leftwards by 2? Actually we see 4 cells at (8,3),(8,5),(10,3),(10,5). Which are like (r-1,c-2),(r-1,c),(r+1,c-2),(r+1,c). That is like one diagonal offset left. Maybe due to the fact that the cross lines at row 9 and column 5 are adjacent to other cross lines? Let's see: For intersection (9,5), the nearest cross columns are 5 and 9. The nearest cross rows are 6 and 9. So the intersection is at the corner of a rectangle formed by crossing of row 6-9 and col 5-9? Might cause pattern shift.

But maybe we misidentified the intersection set. Maybe the 2s are not at intersections but at the positions of original 1s only. So intersections are only at original 1s positions: (1,11),(3,2),(6,9),(9,5). Yes. So 3s are at positions that are at Manhattan distance 2 from any of these 2s, but not overlapping with crosses? For intersection (1,11): positions at distance 2 are (0,9),(0,13),(2,9),(2,13),( -? ), but grid only 0-12, so (0,9),(0,13 out), (2,9),(2,13 out). But output has 3 at (0,10),(0,12),(2,10),(2,12). That's distance 1+1=2? Wait (0,10) distance from (1,11) is |0-1|+|10-11|=1+1=2. So yes. Similarly (2,10). So 3s are at positions at distance 2. Good. For intersection (3,2): distance 2 positions: (2,1),(2,3),(4,1),(4,3),(1,0),(1,4),(5,0),(5,4). But output has 3 at (2,1),(2,3),(4,1),(4,3). It doesn't have 3 at (1,0),(1,4),(5,0),(5,4). Because those cells are on cross lines? Let's check: (1,0) is on cross row 1 but column 0 not cross. But it's on cross row, so 1. So 3 not there. So rule: For each 2, assign 3 to cells at Manhattan distance 2 that are not on any cross line (neither row nor column). That matches: For (1,11), cells at distance 2: (0,9),(0,13),(2,9),(2,13),( - ), but also (0,10),(2,10),(0,12),(2,12) are at distance 2? Wait those are distance 2 as well. Actually Manhattan distance 2 positions include all cells such that |dr|+|dc|=2. That includes (dr=-2,dc=0),(dr=2,dc=0),(dr=0,dc=-2),(0,2),(dr=-1,dc=-1),(dr=-1,dc=1),(1,-1),(1,1). So for (1,11), these are: ( -1,11), (3,11),(1,9),(1,13),(0,10),(0,12),(2,10),(2,12). Of these, cells inside grid: (-1,11) out, (3,11) in, (1,9) in, (1,13) out, (0,10) in, (0,12) in, (2,10) in, (2,12) in. Among these, which are not on cross lines? Cross lines are rows 1,3,6,9 and columns 2,5,9,11. So (3,11) is row 3 cross, so no 3. (1,9) is row 1 cross, no 3. (0,10) not on cross, 3. (0,12) not on cross, 3. (2,10) not on cross, 3. (2,12) not on cross, 3. So 4 3s as seen. Good.

For intersection (3,2): Manhattan distance 2 cells: (-1,2),(5,2),(3,0),(3,4),(2,1),(2,3),(4,1),(4,3). Inside grid: (-1,2) out, (5,2) in, (3,0) in, (3,4) in, (2,1) in, (2,3) in, (4,1) in, (4,3) in. Cross lines: rows 1,3,6,9 and columns 2,5,9,11. So (5,2) is column
