We need to identify transformation rule. Let's analyze the given examples.

Example 1 input 7x15, output 7x7. Observation: Input appears to contain multiple copies of a pattern of size 7x7? Actually input shape 7 rows, 15 columns. The output shape 7 rows, 7 columns. So output is a subgrid of input? Let's overlay: Input rows 0-6 each with 15 columns. Output 7x7 likely extracted from some columns.

Look at input: The pattern of color 4 forms a vertical column at column 7? Actually column indices 0-14. Column 7 is all 4s. There's also column 0-2 with 1s and 0s etc. Let's check input columns: I see col0 values: rows: [1,1,0,0,6,0,0] -> not all same. But col7 is all 4s (since input uses 4 as vertical line). So maybe we are to extract the subgrid that is bounded by the 4 line? The 4 line could be a separator dividing the grid into left and right parts. Output might be the grid between the separator lines? But output has shape 7x7, maybe it's the region to the right of column 7? Let's check: columns 8-14 of input: values: row0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0]; row1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. That matches output first row [0,0,0,5,0,0,0]; second row [0,0,0,1,1,1,0] but input row1 col8-14: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0] not [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. Wait maybe I'm misreading. Let's check input row1: [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So col8-14 are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But output row2 is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. So output row2 not matching. So maybe output is not a direct slice.

Perhaps transformation is to remove the 4 column and something else? Let's examine output: It has 7 rows, 7 columns. For each row, we see pattern of numbers: row0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. row1: [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. row2: [0,0,0,0,0,6,0]. row3: same as row2. row4: [0,0,0,0,2,2,0]. row5: [0,3,3,3,3,0,0]. row6: all zeros.

Input: 7 rows, 15 columns. Colors: 1,0,2,4,5,6,3. The 4 column is at col7. The 5 appears at col11 row0. The 6 appears at col5? Actually input row4 col5? Let's index: row4: [6,0,6,0,3,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So 6 at col0 and col2. 3 at col4-6. 5 at col11 row0. 1 at col0-2? Row0: [1,1,0,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0] has 1 at col0,1; 2 at col4,6; 5 at col11.

Output row1 has 1s at columns 3-5. That corresponds to input row1? Row1 in input: [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. 1 at col0,2. Not 3-5. So output seems to shift the 1s to the right by 3 columns? Actually 1s at col0,2 shift to 3,5 (i.e., +3). 2s at col4,6 shift to 4,6 (no shift). 5 at col11 shift to 3? Wait output row0 has 5 at col3. Input row0 has 5 at col11. So shift -8? Actually col3 vs col11 difference -8. Hmm.

Maybe output is a result of "folding" the grid along the 4 line, aligning shapes from left side to right side? Let's examine: The grid has left side (col0-6) and right side (col8-14). There is a vertical line of 4 at col7. The patterns on left side: 1,2,6,3. On right side: 5? Actually right side has only 5 at row0 col11. Others zeros.

But output has 5 at row0 col3, 1s at row1 col3-5, 6s at row2-3 col5, 2s at row4 col4-5, 3s at row5 col1-4. These correspond to left side patterns but shifted to center? Let's map left side patterns to output: Input left side has 1s at positions: row0 col0,1; row1 col0,2; row2 col0? row2 col0? row2: [0,1,0,0,2,2,2,4...]. So 1 at col1. 2 at col4-6. 3s at row4 col4-6, row5 col4,6? Actually row5: [0,6,0,0,0,3,0,4...] so 3 at col5. Row6: [0,6,0,0,3,0,3,4...] so 3 at col4,6.

So 3s at left side are at col4-6. In output row5 has 3s at col1-4. That is shift left by 3. So mapping left side to output seems to shift left side patterns leftwards by 3 columns. Similarly 6s left side at col0,2 shift to output col? Output row2-3 have 6 at col5: left side 6 at col0,2 shift +5? Wait 6s in input at col0 and col2. Output 6s at col5. So shift +5. Not consistent.

Maybe output is some kind of "rotate" or "reflect"? Let's consider that the output may be the result of rotating left side patterns 90 degrees clockwise and placing at the center. But shapes? 1s shape maybe a plus shape? Let's examine shape of 1s on left side: positions: (row0,0),(row0,1),(row1,0),(row1,2),(row2,1). That's a cross? Output row1 has 1s at (1,3),(1,4),(1,5). Row0 has none. So not.

Alternatively maybe we are extracting the shapes on the left side and superimposing them onto the right side? For example, 5 at right side col11 row0, we place all other shapes relative to that 5? Let's check: In output row0, 5 at col3. That might be relative to left side 1? Hard.

Look at Example 2: Input 15x15, output 15x7. Input has vertical line of 4 at col7 (index 7). Output has 7 columns. Likely output is the right side after removing the 4 line and left side? Let's check: Input right side columns 8-14: values: row0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0]; row1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row11: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row14: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So only row0 has a 5 at col9? Wait col9 is index 9? Actually row0 col9 is 5? Let's check input row0: [2,0,2,0,6,0,6,4,0,5,0,0,0,0,0]. So col9 is 5. So right side only has 5 at row0 col9. Output row0 has 5 at col1? Actually output row0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0] so 5 at col1. So shift -8? Not sure.

Output also contains many other shapes: 2s at col0-1 rows 1-2, 1s at col0-2 rows 4-6 maybe etc. These shapes come from left side of input? Let's check left side of input: columns 0-6. They contain shapes of colors 2,1,6,3? Let's analyze: Input left side patterns: 2 at row0 col0? Actually row0 col0=2, col2=2. 6 at col4,6. 1 at col0? row4 col0=1? Actually row4 [1,1,0,0,3,3,3,4,...]. So 1 at col0,1. 3 at col4-6. Also 2 appears at rows 0-2 col0,2? Yes.

Output left side columns 0-2 correspond to those shapes? Output row1: [2,2,0,...] corresponds to 2s at left side? Input left side 2s at row0-2 col0,2. In output, 2s at row1-2 col0-1. So shift down by 1? Input 2s at row0-2, output at row1-2. And col shift left by something? Input 2s at col0,2 shift to col0,1? So col0 stays, col2 becomes col1. So col shift -1.

Similarly 1s at input left side at row4-6 col0,1 (and maybe col? row5 col? Actually row5 col0? row5 [1,0,1,0,...] so 1 at col0,2). Output 1s at row4-6 col0-2? row4: [1,1,1,0,...] Actually output row4: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0]. Wait output row4? Let's check output 2: row4 is [1,1,1,0,0,0,0] at index 4? Actually output rows 0-14: row4 is [1,1,1,0,0,0,0] (since row indices start 0). That matches 1s at col0-2. Input 1s at row4 col0,1 and row5 col0,2 and row6 col0,2? Let's check: row5 [1,0,1,0,0,3,0,4...] so 1 at col0,2. row6 [1,0,1,0,0,3,0,4...] same. So output row4 has 1s at col0-2; row5? output row5 [0,0,1,1,1,0,0] maybe? Actually output row5: [0,0,1,1,1,0,0] corresponds to 1s at col2-4. That seems shift right by 2. Hard.

Let's examine patterns more carefully. Maybe the transformation is to rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise and then crop to a 7x? Wait.

Observe that in all examples, output is same height as input (e.g., example1: 7 rows same). Example2: 15 rows same. Example3: 11 rows same. So output preserves number of rows but reduces number of columns from 15 to 7 (or 15->7, 11->7). So we are cropping columns. The cropping selects a 7-wide subgrid. Which columns? Let's find which columns in input correspond to output columns.

Example1: input 15 columns, output 7 columns. We need to find mapping. Let's list input columns that are non-zero? The input has a vertical line of 4 at col7. The output seems to include columns that are left of that? Let's check output columns: 0-6. In output, col0 is all zeros except maybe some? Output col0 row5 has 0? Actually output row5 col0 is 0? Wait output row5 [0,3,3,3,3,0,0] so col0 is 0. So output col0 is mostly zeros. So output columns 0-6 all have many zeros. So maybe output columns correspond to columns 8-14? Let's check input columns 8-14: many zeros except 5 at row0 col11. Output row0 col3 has 5. So mapping 8-14 to 0-6: col8->0, col9->1, col10->2, col11->3, col12->4, col13->5, col14->6. That would place 5 at col3, matches output. Now check 1s: input 1s at col0,1,2? Actually 1s left side at col0,1 and col2 in some rows. These would map to output columns -7? They would not be included. So output only contains right side columns 8-14, but also may include some left side shapes? Wait output has 1s at row1 col3-5. Input might have 1s in right side? Let's check right side columns 8-14 for 1s: In input, look at rows: row1 col8-14 all zeros. Row2 all zeros. Row3 all zeros. Row4 all zeros. Row5 all zeros. Row6 all zeros. So no 1s. So output 1s cannot come from right side. So maybe output includes both sides but with some transformation.

What if we rotate the input 90 degrees? Rotated 90 CW would have 15 rows (original cols) and 7 columns (original rows). But output has 7 rows and 7 columns, not 15x7. So not.

What if we reflect input horizontally around the 4 line? That is, take left side and reflect it to right side? For example, left side columns 0-6 reflect to 8-14 (mirror). Then we overlay? Let's test: For each row, reflect left side onto right side. That would produce a 7x15 grid. But output is 7x7. Hmm.

Wait maybe output is the difference between left and right sides? For each row, we shift left side shapes to the right side relative to 4 line? Let's examine: In example1, left side 1s at col0,1 and 2-? They might shift to right side positions 3-5? For row1, left side 1s at col0 and 2, shift to right side col3 and 5 (col0+3, col2+3). That matches output row1 [0,0,0,1,1,1,0] has 1s at col3,4,5. But left side had 1s at col0,2 not 3. So maybe we also include 1 at col1? Wait left side had 1 at col1? Row1 col1=0. So not. So output has 3 consecutive 1s, but input had two 1s separated by one zero. So pattern changed.

Maybe the output is the "difference" between left and right side patterns? Let's consider that left side shapes are transformed into a contiguous shape in output? For 1s, left side has shape like a plus? Maybe output is the shape of 1s after filling gaps? But not.

Let's examine example3: input 11x15, output 11x7. Input right side columns 8-14: there are many 5s? Actually input row0 col12 is 5. Output row0 col4 is 5. So mapping col12->4: offset -8. So output col4 corresponds to input col12. So output col indices 0-6 correspond to input col? 8->0,9->1,10->2,11->3,12->4,13->5,14->6. So output is just right side columns 8-14? Let's test: Input right side col12 has 5 at row0. Output row0 col4 has 5. Yes. Input right side col? 8-14 all zeros except col12. So output only has 5 at col4. That matches.

Now check 2s: In example3, output has 2s at row3 col3-4? Actually output row3: [0,0,0,2,2,0,0] (row index 3). That is at col3,4. Input right side columns 8-14: let's look at row? Which row has 2s? Input left side has 2s at col? Input left side 2s at col? In input, row? Let's scan: Row0 has 2 at col0,2? Actually row0 [2,0,2,0,6,0,6,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0]. So 2s at col0,2. Row1 [2,0,2,0,0,6,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] 2 at col0,2. Row2 [2,2,2,0,0,6,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] 2 at col0,1,2. So left side 2s. Output row3 has 2s at col3,4. That could be left side 2s shifted to right side columns 3,4. So mapping left side col0->3, col1->4, col2->? maybe 5? But output row3 has only two 2s. So maybe left side 2s after cropping to only 3 columns? Wait.

Let's examine output 2s: They are at row3 col3-4. But input left side 2s at row3? Row3 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] has no 2s. So 2s in output come from left side rows 0-2, but output row3. So maybe output rows are offset relative to input rows? Let's check mapping: Input rows 0-2 correspond to output row3? That is shift down by 3. Similarly, input row0 had 2s at col0,2. Output row3 has 2s at col3,4. So mapping col0->3, col2->5? But output col5 is 0. So not.

Wait maybe output rows correspond to input columns? Let's consider that output rows correspond to input columns 0-10? But output has 11 rows. Input has 15 columns. So not.

Maybe output is the "intersection" of left and right sides? For each row, we take the shape on left side, reflect across the 4 line, and overlay onto right side. Then we crop to 7 columns of right side? Let's try for example3: Left side 2s at rows0-2, col0-2. Reflect across 4 line: 4 line at col7. Mirror: a point at col0 becomes col14? Actually reflection across vertical line at col7 would map col x to col 14 - x? Because total width 15, index 0-14. Mirror across center of 4 line at col7: mapping col i to 14 - i. So col0 -> 14, col1 -> 13, col2 -> 12. So left side 2s would map to col14,13,12. In right side columns 8-14, those are 12-14. So 2s would appear at col12-14. But output only has 2s at col3-4. So not.

Maybe transformation is to rotate left side shapes by 90 degrees clockwise and place them on right side columns? For example, left side 2s at rows0-2 col0-2: rotate 90 CW -> shape of 2s at col? Not.

Let's analyze example2's output more carefully. Output 2 has columns 0-6. It shows 5 at row0 col1. 2s at rows1-2 col0-1. 1s at rows4-6 col? Let's list output 2:

Row0: [0,5,0,0,0,0,0]
Row1: [2,2,0,0,0,0,0]
Row2: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0]
Row3: [0,0,1,1,1,0,0]
Row4: [0,0,0,0,6,0,0]
Row5: [0,0,0,0,6,0,0]
Row6: [0,0,0,0,6,0,0]
Row7: [0,0,0,0,6,0,0]
Row8: [0,3,3,3,3,0,0]
Row9: [0,6,0,0,0,0,0]
Row10: [0,6,0,0,0,0,0]
Row11: [0,1,1,1,0,0,0]
Row12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Row13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Row14: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Observations: Output contains shapes of 5,2,1,3,6. These correspond to colors present in input left side? Let's check input left side: columns 0-6. Colors: 2,6,1,3. 5 appears only on right side? Actually 5 appears on left side? Input left side 5? No 5 not in left side. But output has 5. So 5 must come from right side. Indeed input right side has 5 at row0 col9? Actually row0 col9=5. So 5 is from right side.

So output includes shapes from both sides: 5 from right side, others from left side.

Now, mapping of positions: Let's map input left side to output positions.

Take left side 2s: Input 2s positions: row0 col0,2; row1 col0,2; row2 col0,1,2. That's a 3x3 block with missing corners? Output 2s positions: row1 col0-1, row2 col0-2. They form a 2x2 block? Not exactly. Let's list output 2s positions: (1,0),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2). That's shape: like an L? Actually 2x3 rectangle? It is a 2 rows by 3 columns block starting at (1,0). Input 2s form a 3x3 block missing corners (top left? Actually input has 2 at (0,0),(0,2),(1,0),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2). That's like a shape with two missing corners (0,1),(1,1). Output has 2s at (1,0),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2). So output shape is missing (0,0),(0,2),(1,2). So it's not a simple transform.

Let's check left side 1s: Input 1s at rows4-6: row4 col0,1; row5 col0,2; row6 col0,2. Output 1s: positions: row2 col0-2, row3 col2-4, row11 col1-3? Wait output row11 has 1s at col1-3. So 1s appear in three separate rows: 2,3,11. That's weird.

Check 3s: Input 3s at rows? left side 3s at rows? Row? Input left side 3s appear at rows? For example row? Let's look at input rows for 3: row? Actually input row? Let's inspect row4: [1,1,0,0,3,3,3,4,...] 3 at col4-6. Row5: [1,0,1,0,0,3,0,4...] 3 at col5. Row6: [1,0,1,0,0,3,0,4...] 3 at col5. So 3s in left side are at col4-6 rows4-6. Output 3s at row8 col1-4. So mapping: left side 3s at rows4-6 -> output row8. So shift down by 4? And columns 4-6 -> output col1-4. So mapping col4->1, col5->2, col6->3? Actually output row8 col1-4: [0,3,3,3,3,0,0] has 3s at col1-4. So left side col4-6 map to output col1-4 (col4->1, col5->2, col6->3). So mapping col offset -3. So col4->1, col5->2, col6->3. That matches: col4-6 shift left by 3. And rows: left side rows4-6 shift down by 4 to row8. So mapping row +4. So transformation: shift left side shapes right by 3 columns, down by 4 rows? But we also have 2s mapping? Input 2s at rows0-2 shift down by 1? Let's test: For 2s input at rows0-2 shift down by 1 to rows1-3? Output 2s at rows1-2 only, not 3. So maybe 2s shift down by 1 and left by 1? Let's check columns: input 2s at col0,2. Output 2s at col0-2. So col0->0, col2->2. So no shift. So contradictory.

Let's consider that output is derived by rotating the left side shapes 90 degrees counterclockwise and placing them in a new grid of size 7x7? For example, left side 2s shape rotated CCW would be a shape of 2s at positions maybe matching output? Let's test: left side shape of 2s: coordinates relative to origin (0,0 at top-left of left side grid). Coordinates: (0,0),(0,2),(1,0),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2). Rotate CCW 90: (x,y) -> (y, -x). But we need to shift to fit. Let's compute: For each (r,c), new r'=c, new c'=2 - r? Actually for a 3x3 grid, rotate CCW: new (r',c') = (c, 2 - r). Let's compute: (0,0)->(0,2); (0,2)->(2,2); (1,0)->(0,1); (1,2)->(2,1); (2,0)->(0,0); (2,1)->(1,0); (2,2)->(2,0). That yields shape: positions: (0,2),(2,2),(0,1),(2,1),(0,0),(1,0),(2,0). So 2s at (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2). That's a 3x3 block missing (1,1),(1,2?) Actually we have 7 positions: a 3x3 minus (1,1). So shape: top row full, left column full, bottom row full except maybe something. Output 2s shape is at rows1-2, columns0-2? That shape: (1,0),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2). That's 5 positions. So not matching.

Maybe we should think differently: The input seems to have patterns separated by a vertical line of 4. The left side has patterns of various colors (1,2,3,6). The right side has mostly zeros except a 5 in some positions. The output seems to be a 7x7 grid that contains shapes of all these colors arranged in a particular arrangement: 5 at top row col3, 1s in next row, 6s in next two rows, 2s in a row, 3s in a row. That seems like a "stacking" of shapes from left side in order of their vertical positions? Let's see: In input, the left side patterns are arranged vertically: from top to bottom: 1 at top (rows0-2), 6 at row4-6, 2 at row? Actually 2 appears at top rows0-2. 3 appears at rows4-6. 5 appears on right side at row0. In output, the order from top to bottom is 5,1,6,2,3. Not matching vertical order.

Maybe the output is a "sorted" by color value? Colors: 5,1,6,2,3. That order is not sorted ascending or descending. 5>1<6>2<3. Hmm.

Maybe the output is the "transposed" of the input's pattern of color 4 (the separator) with shapes redistributed? Let's examine the arrangement of shapes relative to the 4 line. In input, the 4 line at col7 divides the grid into left and right. The shapes on left side are at positions relative to the 4 line: e.g., 1 at left of 4, 2 left, 6 left, 3 left, 5 right. The output shows them arranged along a diagonal? Not.

Maybe the output is the "grid of colors" formed by the intersection of the left side shapes and the right side shape's positions? For example, output cell (i,j) is color of left side shape at row i, column j? But output grid is 7x7, input left side width is 7 columns (0-6). So maybe we just take left side grid as 7x7? Let's check input left side: first 7 columns of input 7x15 are 7x7. That left side grid is: rows0-6, cols0-6. Let's extract that: row0: [1,1,0,0,2,0,2]; row1: [1,0,1,0,2,0,2]; row2: [0,1,0,0,2,2,2]; row3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row4: [6,0,6,0,3,3,3]; row5: [0,6,0,0,0,3,0]; row6: [0,6,0,0,3,0,3]. That is a 7x7 grid. Does the output equal this? Compare to output: row0 output [0,0,0,5,0,0,0] vs left side row0 [1,1,0,0,2,0,2]. Not equal. So output is not left side.

What about right side 7x7? Right side columns 8-14: rows0-6: row0: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0]; row1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; row6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. That is mostly zeros except 5. That matches output row0 partially but not 1s,6s,2s,3s.

Thus output appears to combine left and right side shapes. How? Maybe output is the "overlay" of left side shapes and right side shapes after rotating left side shapes 90 degrees clockwise and aligning them with right side shapes? For example, left side 1s shape rotated 90 clockwise becomes 1s shape at output row1 col3-5? Let's test: Left side 1s shape positions: (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,2),(2,1). Rotate 90 CW: (r,c)->(c, 6-r). For 7x7 grid? Actually left side grid is 7x7. Rotating 90 CW: new (r',c') = (c, 6 - r). Let's compute: (0,0)->(0,6); (0,1)->(1,6); (1,0)->(0,5); (1,2)->(2,5); (2,1)->(1,4). So positions: (0,6),(1,6),(0,5),(2,5),(1,4). That yields 1s at (0,5),(0,6),(1,4),(1,6),(2,5). Output 1s are at row1 col3-5: (1,3),(1,4),(1,5). Not matching.

Maybe left side shapes are mirrored horizontally: (r,c)->(r,6-c). For 1s: positions: (0,0)->(0,6),(0,1)->(0,5),(1,0)->(1,6),(1,2)->(1,4),(2,1)->(2,5). That yields 1s at (0,5),(0,6),(1,4),(1,6),(2,5). Still not output.

Maybe we need to shift left side shapes to align with right side 5? In output, 5 at row0 col3. 5 originally at right side col11 row0. That is column offset -8. So maybe we shift right side shapes left by 8 to align with left side? Then 5 becomes at col3. So output col3 matches. Then we overlay left side shapes? But left side shapes are at columns 0-6. They would stay. So final output would contain 5 at col3, 1s at left side positions (col0-6). But output 1s are at col3-5, not left side columns. So that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe we need to rotate the entire input 90 degrees clockwise, then crop? Let's test: Input 7x15 rotated 90 CW becomes 15x7. Then maybe we crop to 7x7? But output is 7x7. So maybe we take the 7x7 central subgrid of the rotated grid? Let's rotate input 90 CW: The new grid has 15 rows, 7 columns. The central 7x7 subgrid might be rows 4-10, cols 0-6. Let's compute approximate positions: But not easy.

Let's try to derive a rule from example3: Input 11x15, output 11x7. We know output appears to be a 7-wide subgrid extracted from input. Let's see which columns of input correspond to output columns. We saw mapping col8->0,9->1,10->2,11->3,12->4,13->5,14->6. That
